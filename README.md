# BSPWM Zorin OS themes

Script to generate themes that correct Zorin OS desktop themes to work with BSPWM window manager.

You need to have the original Zorin OS desktop themes installed before run this script. You can download then in this link: [https://github.com/ZorinOS/zorin-desktop-themes](https://github.com/ZorinOS/zorin-desktop-themes).

To install the correction themes, run:

```shell
./generate.py <path-where-Zorin-OS-themes-are-saved> <path-to-save-corrected-themes>
```

The `<path-where-Zorin-OS-themes-are-saved>` need to be an absolute path relative to the root of the system '/'.

This script only generates the correction themes. I do not own the rights of Zorin OS themes.
